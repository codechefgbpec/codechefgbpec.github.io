# Priority Queue Data Structure

Priority Queue is an extension of queue with following properties:

1. Every item has a **priority associated** with it.
2. An element with **high priority is dequeued before** an element with low priority.
3. If two elements have the **same priority**, they are served according to their **order in the queue**.

A typical priority queue supports following operations:
1. `insert(item, priority)`: Inserts an item with given priority.
2. `getHighestPriority()`: Returns the highest priority item.
3. `deleteHighestPriority()`: Removes the highest priority item.

#### Applications of Priority Queue:
1. CPU Scheduling
2. Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree, etc
3. All queue applications where priority is involved.
