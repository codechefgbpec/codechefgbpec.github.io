# Queue Data Structure

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.


### Fun-Fact :

Queue which is implemented using a doubly linked list. The maximum size of the queue will be equal to the **total number of frames available (cache size)**. The most recently used pages will be near rear end and least recently pages will be near front end.

### Learn by Implementing
Try to implement these things:
1. **Implement a queue using an array** (enqueue, size, is_empty, front, dequeue, handle_queue,capacity_full) => [Solution](https://www.javatpoint.com/array-representation-of-queue)
2. **Build a queue using a linked list** => [Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-linked-list-implementation/)
3. **Reversed Queue**, Write a function that takes a queue as an input and returns a reversed version of it. => [Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reversing-a-queue/)
4. **Build a Queue From Stacks** i.e. use stack data structure for implementing all queue methods like enqueue and dequeue. => [Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-using-stacks/)
5. **Implement BFS using Queue** => [Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/)
